_I wrote this post on privacy and user data ownership in consumer startups back in 2012 when Facebook
bought Instagram._

_This seems even more germane today as we start to see Quantified Self startups that
blur the line between social and health data being acquired.
Case in point: [The recent Moves app and their ToS Changes post acquisition.](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/05/05/after-facebook-deal-moves-app-changes-privacy-policy/)
I should point out that Moves does allow you to [export your data in full and to delete your account.](https://accounts.moves-app.com/export)_

Let's talk about this on [Twitter.](http://www.twitter.com/_sandeep)

## Consumer Data in Social Media Startups


Facebook recently bought the photography start-up Instagram, for a billion
dollars. Commentary is flying hot and heavy about the  strategic value,
appropriateness of the valuation, and the coming ruin of the experience.
Stepping away from the hoopla for a moment, we can see that hidden in the
backlash is a real frustration with the data ownership model prevalent in
social media.

### The Privacy Challenge

Most social media companies today aim to create value by aggregating
information about their users - Check-Ins (foursquare), TV Habits (Get Glue,
Miso), Photos (Facebook, Instagram, Path) - and monetizing the information by
delivering targeted advertising. The terms of service contend that the company
owns and/or can maintain the data user has uploaded or created on the site in
perpetuity.

Industry has quickly moved to address breaches but have largely ignored
another significant user problem: data ownership during change of control events – i.e.
acquisition, IPO or more likely for most startups wind down. For example, Wal-Mart
recently bought Social Calendar - a service that creates birthday and
holiday reminders to augment their database with customers’ dates. Typically,
the company blog announces the control event with promises of no changes at
this time followed by quiet changes to match the buyer’s policies. Lather, rinse,
and repeat. The consumer typically has no clear control over continued use of
data despite material changes.


While acquisitions and IPOs trigger the psyche's ingrained response against
corporate Goliaths, the more insidious case is when your favorite startup goes
bankrupt or shuts down. Who owns the consumer data? Will the highest bidder
in a liquidation honor the privacy commitments in the initial terms? When there
is a thriving black market for personal information - Who will guarantee that “worthless”
assets of a defunct startup won't end up in some hacker's lair?


### A Modest Proposal

The industry can address this following two simple rules:


 1. Allow users to completely and easily delete their user information from your
site (Instagram seems to do this)


 2. Allow users to export all their data in a simple human readable experience
(HTML, PDF, JPGs, TXT, etc.) and a machine readable format that can be
imported by other service - Data portability (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.) - Instagram
users have to do this through 3rd party services today.


### But there is a Catch.

This is a catch-22 for Startups. Well-intentioned startups might want to
do the right thing for the customer and provide data portability options. However,
doing so could put these same startups at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to acquisitions.
Some buyers simply see the transaction as a user/data acquisition rather than a product/service
acquisition. In these cases, all other things being equal, a startup that can deliver user data will
garner a higher valuation than one with caveats.


### Regulators, Mount Up.. But is it the right choice?

One way out of this quandary is for the regulatory bodies to make data portability
mandatory - Users own their data and are allowed to move it into and out of
systems at their will. Somewhat similar to the FCC mandate for phone number
portability between carriers.

The devil however, as they say, is in the details. Today, social media is nascent
and evolving in terms of its data collection practices. And, the
regulators and legislators are too far away from the complexity of innovation to
effectively create safeguards without stifling progress and innovation.


Let’s hope that in the Internet age the industry can quickly develop responsible
corporate leaders who set clear consumer friendly standards for exporting and
extinguishing consumer data before being regulated from the outside.
