###Twitter Lists

I've been using Twitter at [Nitrous.IO.](http://www.nitrous.io/?utm_source="
sandeepchivukula.com"&utm_medium="blog") to keep up with
some of the best developers and devops folks in the industry.
Of course, Twitter is also great for checking out interesting
posts from people like [Annie Atkins](https://twitter.com/AnnieAtkins), the
designer for Wes Anderson's new movie _The Grand Hotel Budapest._

However, if you come across a list of, say, [100 Most Wanted Speakers at tech conferences](http://blog.bizzabo.com/the-100-most-wanted-speakers-at-tech-conferences)
or have a list of customers that you want to stay abreast
of, there is no easy way to quickly add them into a
[Twitter List](https://twitter.com/lists)

After looking around and finding nothing but spammy junk and
complicated social media management tools - I decided to do
whip up something quick and simple.
