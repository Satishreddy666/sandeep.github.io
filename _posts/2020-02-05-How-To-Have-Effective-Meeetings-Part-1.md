### 55 Million Meetings in the US each day. They're mostly bad.


Each day the US "holds 55 million meetings" according to a recent Freakanomics episode on NPR.

Getting together with people should be a happy and playful experience.
Yet, mention the word "meeting" and watch the fun leave 55 million faces.

I can only imagine the global cost to humanity of bad meetings.

### No Meetings: Not an option.

The sophomoric response to bad meetings is to eliminate *ALL* meetings.
But reality is that "no meetings" teams end up with all the same meetings with fun names to fill role that the old meetings used to serve.

Meetings are the set of processes, rituals and at times the places where people come together towards a common purpose. If you work with people to tackle complex, meaningful, work you will need meetings.

### Meetings are hard work and we're not well trained.

Effective meetings need a combination of planning, facilitation, communication, decision making, and conflict management skills.
There are many consulting careers built on each of these fields.
Yet many of us have little exposure or practice in them.



### Effective Meetings Cheat Sheet: Before the Meeting

The best meeting culture I've experienced was at Intel. Every employee takes a class called Effective Meetings.
Effective meetings lays out a clear meeting framework: planning, execution and follow up.


I'll share some of key tips and effective practices that happen _Before the meeting_ to set you up for success.


1. ##### Know why you're meeting and the meeting type: Process vs. Mission

    * _Process Meetings:_ Regularly scheduled to coordinate action fixed agenda - eg: 1-1s, Core Team Meetings.
    * _Mission Meetings:_ Ad-hoc meetings to solve a specific problem and/or produce a decision.

1. ##### Don't have a meeting to "present" something that can be covered in an email:

    If you're only communicating status and everyone is going to continue according to the prior plan. Send the status update by email/slack/carrier pigeon as appropriate.

    Only meet to co-ordinate a change of action.

    _Eg: You realize that you need marketing to change their ad campaigns based on this week's result. It requires a quick and complex coordination across teams. This is a process meeting._

1. ##### If you want the meeting, Publish the Agenda:

    The agenda defines the purpose of the meeting. Eg: What decision are you making? What outcome do you want?  Publish the agenda when you call the meeting.

    A good agenda includes: the purpose, the items to discussed,  time allocated for each item, any roles and  decision making process. (Why, What, When , Who, How)

       Example Agenda

       Meeting to Decide on Color for the Bike Shed

       * Collect Opens Sandeep 2 mins
       * Review Customer Feedback (Paul - CS - 4 mins)
       * Understand Budget Impact of color choice (Peter - Finance 4 mins)
       * Final inputs on  Color (All - 4 mins)
       Decision Maker: Jenny - Consultative
       Minutes: Jack

1. ##### All meetings are optional:
  * You're not obligated to attend a meeting because you recieved an invitation.
  You should attend if you can contribute towards the meeting's purpose.
  * On that note, if there is no a published agenda - there is no purpose and you are not obligated to attend.
  * If the agenda doesn't need you input and you're are not involved in the decision making process. You can skip the meeting and wait for meeting minutes.
  * A meeting that is over time. You're under no obligation to be late to your next commitment.

### What's Next?

By taking the time to articulate a clear and clean Agenda you've already done better than the 50th Percentile meeting.Now, the right people needed to make the decision are in the room, they are clear on what decision is to make and their role in making the decision.

In the next post I'll cover tips on how to conduct, manage and conclude meetings for greatest impact covering Time Management, Meeting Roles, Decision Making Process, Minutes and Follow Up. Follow me on twitter or Linked In if you want to be notified of the next post.

PS - _If you worked at Intel and remember something different or something that I missed - shoot me a note._
